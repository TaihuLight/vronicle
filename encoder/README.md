minih264super
==========
(forked and edited from https://github.com/lieff/minih264)

Small, but yet reasonably fast H264/SVC encoder single-header library with SSE/NEON optimizations.
Decoder can be popped up in future.

Disclaimer: code highly experimental.

## Comparison with [x264](https://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html)

Rough comparison with x264 on an i7-6700K:

`x264 -I 30 --profile baseline --preset veryfast --tune zerolatency -b 0 -r 1 --qp 33 --ipratio 1.0 --qcomp 1.0 -o x264.264 --fps 30 vectors/foreman.cif --input-res 352x288 --slices 1 --threads 1`

vs

`./h264enc_x64 vectors/foreman.cif`

You can compare results in motion using ffplay/mpv players on vectors/out_ref.264 and vectors/x264.264 .

## Usage

Please check scripts folder for building the project

Suppose you have compiled the x86 version

```
h264e_test [options] <input[frame_size].yuv> <output.264>
```

```
Frame size can be (default is 720p): WxH sqcif qvga svga 4vga sxga xga vga qcif 4cif
    4sif cif sif pal ntsc d1 16cif 16sif 720p 4SVGA 4XGA 16VGA 16VGA

Options:
    -gen            - generate input instead of passing <input.yuv>
    -qop<n>         - key frame period >= 0
    -qp<n>          - set QP [10..51]
    -kbps<n>        - set bitrate (fps=30 assumed)
    -maxframes<n>   - encode no more than given number of frames
    -threads<n>     - use <n> threads for encode
    -speed<n>       - speed [0..10], 0 means best quality
    -denoise        - use temporal noise supression
    -stats          - print frame statistics
    -psnr           - print psnr statistics
    -fps<n>         - set target fps of the video, default is 30
    -is_yuyv        - if the frames' chroma is in yuyv 4:2:2 format(note that psnr might not work when using yuyv)
```


## SVC

Minih264 supports both spatial and temporal layers. Spatial layers are almost same as encode 2 independent AVC streams except for Intra frames prediction.
Following diagram shows minih264 SVC scheme for two spatial layers:

![SVC diargam](images/svc.png?raw=true)

That's because P frames spatial prediction are almost useless in practice. But for Intra frames there is a ~20% benefit in full resolution frame size.
Note that decoder must have both base layer I frame _and_ full resolution SVC I frame to decode whole sequence of next P frames in full resolution.

## Limitations

The following major features are not supported compared to x264 (baseline):

 * Trellis quantization.
 * Select prediction mode using Sum of Absolute Transform Differences (SATD).
 * 4x4 motion compensation.
